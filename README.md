# Pico-KITT
A simple Python program to create a KITT scanner effect on a NeoPixel strip using the Raspberry Pi Pico.

The NeoPixel strip I am using came in the PiHut Maker Advent Calendar for 2022 (https://thepihut.com/products/maker-advent-calendar-includes-raspberry-pi-pico-h).

It has been wired up so the signal line is on pin 28 of the Pico, which is the same as in the advent calendar tutorial for day 12 (https://thepihut.com/blogs/raspberry-pi-tutorials/maker-advent-calendar-day-12-rgb-led-strip).
